# Write a Program to Convert Kilometers to Miles

# Take input from the user 
kilometers = float(input("Enter distance in Kilometers: "))

# Convert the distance from kilometers to miles
miles = kilometers * 0.621371       # 1 kilometer is approximately 0.621371 miles

# Diplaying the result 
print(f"{kilometers} kilometers is equal to {miles} miles")
